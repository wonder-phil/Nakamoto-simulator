> Learning plan<br /><br />
1.  Start with the end-points, see [end-points](./end-points/) <br />
2.  Add a static-card, see [static-card-example](./card-example-static/)<br />
3.  Make the static-card dynamic, see [dynamic-card-example](./card-example-dynamic/)<br />
4.  Combine dynamic cards with endpoints, see [dynamic-card-example-w-endpoint](./card-example-dynamic-w-endpoint) <br /><br />
